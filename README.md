# Agentic AI with LangGraph â€“ Practice Repository

This repository serves as a dedicated space for exploring and practicing concepts in **Agentic AI** using the [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) framework.

LangGraph enables the creation of graph-based, stateful agent workflows by combining the power of language models with structured execution. It supports building robust multi-agent systems that incorporate memory, tool usage, conditional flows, and modular logic.

## Purpose

- To develop a strong conceptual and practical understanding of agentic AI systems.
- To experiment with LangGraph and its integration with language models and tools.
- To document learnings, prototypes, and implementations from agentic AI workflows.
- To contribute towards building scalable, traceable, and composable agent architectures.

## Focus Areas

- Agent orchestration using graph-based flow control.
- Memory management across agent interactions.
- Integration with language models, vector stores, and APIs.
- Building modular, interpretable, and state-aware agentic systems.

## Technologies

- Python 3
- LangGraph
- LangChain
- OpenAI / Claude / Mistral (LLM providers)
- Vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Chroma)
- Optional: Streamlit, Gradio, or CLI-based interfaces
